# Measures

## Geometry

The ellipse approach calculates this using the contours of the segmented shape,
providing as measurements: major_axis, minor_axis, orientation.

Steps:
1. Binarize the image.
2. Find contours.
3. Approximate the ellipse.


```python
def find_geometry(frame):
	cnt=melt_pool.find_contour(img_bin)
	if cnt is not None:
		ellipse = melt_pool.find_ellipse(cnt)
		(x, y), (h, v), angle = ellipse
```

## Low-pass filter

Discrete first order low-pass filter:

```
y[k] = a * x[k] + (1 - a) * y[k-1]
a = (2 * pi * DT * fc) / (2 * pi * DT * fc + 1)
```

x is the input signal and y the filtered one, being a the smoothing factor and
DT the sample time.

```
a = DT / (RC + DT)
fc = 1 / 2 * pi * RC
```

```
$\alpha = {\Delta T \over (RC + \Delta T)}$
$f_c = {1 \over {2 \cdot \pi \cdot RC}}$
```

The smoothing factor is calculated from the cut-off frequency.
